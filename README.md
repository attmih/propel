propel
======

PROPerty based Expression Language for modeling business data and logic.

Propel helps you define your business logic in a pure and portable format and provides tools to execute it in different environments such as a relational databases (SQL), the server's memory (Scala), the client's memory (JavaScript) or even spreadsheets. 

The primary goal is to achieve portability in space and time. You should be able to run your business logic anywhere. You should not be tied to a specific technology and be forced to rewrite large systems whenever a new technology emerges. Write the logic once and only touch it if the business requirements change.
